# Tweed: Experiments With Nottui

An experiment on top of Nottui:

- `open Tweed.Std` for a (hopefully) cleaner API.
- Module `Modal_shortcuts` to make keyboard-based menus mixing Vim-like keys and
  `dmenu`-like search.
- WIP `Debug` and `Errors` widgets.

## Example

In a terminal:

```sh
dune exec ./test/basic.exe
```
